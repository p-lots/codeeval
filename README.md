Various CodeEval exercises completed in C++ between 2015-2016.

Inside are folders named after the corresponding challenge. Inside each folder are a *.cpp file containing the solution and a *.txt file with sample inputs. The README.md contains the challenge description exactly as it appears on the CodeEval page linked at the top of each *.cpp file. Only problems that have been marked solved are in this repo.

As of November 2018 (probably earlier), CodeEval is no more. A few of the solutions are missing an accompanying README.md: everything after and including pointInCircle in the moderate folder. I have included them as they represent completed solutions.
