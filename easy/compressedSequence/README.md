# COMPRESSED SEQUENCE

### CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

Assume that someone dictates you a sequence of numbers, and you need to write it down. For brevity, he dictates it as follows: first he dictates the number of consecutive identical numbers, and then - the number itself.

For example:  
The sequence below
```
1 1 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 14 14 14 11 11 11 2
```  
is dictated as follows:  
```
two times one, three times three, four times two, three times fourteen, three times eleven, one time two
```  
and you have to write down the sequence  
```
2 1 3 3 4 2 3 14 3 11 1 2
```  
Your task is to write a program that compresses a given sequence using this approach.

### INPUT SAMPLE:

Your program should accept a path to a file as its first argument that contains T number of lines. Each line is a test case represented by a sequence of integers with the length L, where each integer is N separated by a space.

```
40 40 40 40 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 57 57 92 92 92 92 92 86 86 86 
86 86 86 86 86 86 86
73 73 73 73 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
1 1 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 14 14 14 11 11 11 2
7
```

### OUTPUT SAMPLE:

For each test case, print out a compressed sequence of numbers separated by a single space, one per line.

For example:

```
4 40 8 29 2 57 5 92 10 86
4 73 10 41
2 1 3 3 4 2 3 14 3 11 1 2
1 7
```

### CONSTRAINTS:

1. T is in a range from 20 to 50.
2. N is in a range from 0 to 99.
3. L is in a range from 1 to 400.
